%---------------------------------------------------------
%I am interested in artificial intelligence, brain-computer interfaces, and computational neuroscience. My field of interest covers machine learning and deep learning, brain-computer interfaces, computational neuroscience, neural networks, evolutionary computation, bio-inspired algorithms, and multi-agent and complex systems.


%I am a curiosity-driven researcher with professional experience from both academia and industry looking for another challenge. I have strong computer science, mathematics, and machine learning background. 
%My broad interests cover artificial intelligence, machine and deep learning, brain-computer interfaces, neuroimaging, and computational neuroscience.
